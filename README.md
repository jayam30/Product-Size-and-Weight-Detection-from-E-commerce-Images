# Product Size and Weight Detection from E-commerce Images

## Project Overview

This project aims to automate the extraction of product attributes, specifically size and weight, directly from images of products listed on e-commerce platforms. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, the solution enhances the quality of product data, which is crucial for e-commerce platforms where missing or incomplete descriptions can affect customer experience and sales. 

The model uses computer vision techniques to accurately predict these attributes, helping to streamline processes and reduce manual data entry.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images of products from e-commerce websites along with associated metadata:
- **Columns**:
  - `image_link`: The URL of the product image.
  - `group_id`: The product category code.
  - `entity_name`: The attribute being predicted (e.g., `weight`, `volume`).
  - `entity_value`: The true value of the attribute (e.g., `34 grams`).

Training data consists of 8,000+ labeled images, which were preprocessed and augmented to improve model generalization.

## Installation
