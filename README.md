# Product Size and Weight Detection from E-commerce Images

## Project Overview

This project aims to automate the extraction of product attributes, specifically size and weight, directly from images of products listed on e-commerce platforms. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, the solution enhances the quality of product data, which is crucial for e-commerce platforms where missing or incomplete descriptions can affect customer experience and sales. 

The model uses computer vision techniques to accurately predict these attributes, helping to streamline processes and reduce manual data entry.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images of products from e-commerce websites along with associated metadata:
- **Columns**:
  - `image_link`: The URL of the product image.
  - `group_id`: The product category code.
  - `entity_name`: The attribute being predicted (e.g., `weight`, `volume`).
  - `entity_value`: The true value of the attribute (e.g., `34 grams`).

Training data consists of 8,000+ labeled images, which were preprocessed and augmented to improve model generalization.

## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

Model Overview
This project leverages the Qwen-2-VL model, which is designed to analyze and extract entity values like weight and size from product images. The model was trained on a large dataset and fine-tuned with several optimization techniques, including:

Population-Based Training (PBT)
Asynchronous Hyperband
μTransfer (PEFT) for enhanced accuracy
The output prediction consists of values with the correct units such as "grams", "kilograms", or "centimeters," based on the product entity being detected.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for building the model.
Qwen-2-VL: The machine learning model used for entity extraction from images.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: Frameworks for model training and evaluation.
Population-Based Training (PBT): Used for hyperparameter optimization.
Asynchronous Hyperband: For effective resource allocation during model training.
PEFT (μTransfer): To improve transfer learning and generalization across product categories.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing.
Pandas & NumPy: For data handling and manipulation.
Training Procedure
Data Preprocessing: Images are downloaded and preprocessed using OpenCV for resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Model Training: The Qwen-2-VL model is fine-tuned on the dataset using Population-Based Training and Asynchronous Hyperband to optimize hyperparameters.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated based on the accuracy of predicted product attributes (size, weight) compared to ground truth values.
Results
Achieved a 25% improvement in product detail extraction accuracy.
Reduced manual labeling and processing effort by 40%, enhancing overall efficiency for e-commerce product listings.
